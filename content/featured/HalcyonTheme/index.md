A fully functional Java project, The Leading University Assistant Project which is my 3rd year Java Project, contains details about colleges, universities, and schools in general. It was developed so that the university and the institutions that are affiliated with it could manage, track, and conduct intricate operations like centralized admission, centralized testing, and much more.
